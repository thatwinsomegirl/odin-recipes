        <h3>This is a favorite recipe of my family and a brilliant way to
            utilize the bounty from your summer garden.  It's divine and a
            complete meal on it's own, but to make it even more filling or
            to stretch further for company, try pairing with the <a href="/Users/amyadams/repos/odin-recipes/recipes/Basic_Louisiana_Rice.html">Basic Louisiana Rice</a> recipe.</h3>
