            </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Add the beans to a large bowl.  Add enough water to cover the
                    top of the beans by 2 inches.  Add 2 tablespoons kosher salt and stir.
                    Cover and soak overnight.  Drain and rinse before preparing recipe.</li>
                <li>In a large Dutch oven, heat oil or lard over medium-high heat until shimmering. 
                    Add andouille and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add 
                    onion, bell pepper, and celery. Season with salt and cook, stirring, until 
                    vegetables have softened and are just starting to brown around the edges, about 
                    8 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 45 seconds. Add 
                    cayenne pepper, sage, and a generous 10 to 12 grinds of fresh black pepper. Cook, 
                    stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add beans, chicken stock and enough 
                    water to cover by about 2 inches (roughly 4 to 6 cups), ham hock (if using), 
                    thyme, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil and reduce to a bare simmer. Cover and 
                    cook until beans are completely tender, 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours. (Older beans can 
                    take longer.)</li>
                <li>Discard bay leaves and thyme stems. Season to taste with hot sauce, a few 
                    teaspoons of cider vinegar, and more salt and pepper, as needed. Remove 1 cup of 
                    beans to a bowl and mash with a fork, then return to the pot.  Add parsley and 
                    green onions.  Simmer for about 15 minutes, taste and adjust.</li>
                <li>Serve warm over <a href="/Users/amyadams/repos/odin-recipes/recipes/Basic_Louisiana_Rice.html">rice</a>.</li>
